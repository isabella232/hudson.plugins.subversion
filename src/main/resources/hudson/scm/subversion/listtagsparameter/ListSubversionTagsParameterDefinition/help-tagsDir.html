  Specify the Subversion repository URL which contains the tags to be listed
  when triggering a new build.<br/>
  When you enter the URL, Hudson automatically checks if it can connect to it.
  If access requires authentication, you'll be prompted for the necessary
  credential. If you already have a working credential but would like to change
  it for some other reasons, click <a href="{0}/scm/SubversionSCM/enterCredential" target="_blank">
  this link</a> and specify a different credential.
