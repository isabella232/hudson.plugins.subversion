  When turned on, this option will allow validating Subversion's repository URLs
  only up to the first <code>$</code> sign, that is, up to the first encountered
  variable.<br/>
  For example, the repository URL <code>https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/trunk/hudson/plugins/$PLUGIN</code>,
  which validation raises an error since <code>$PLUGIN</code> can't be resolved
  at validation-time, would be successfully validated as
  <code>https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/trunk/hudson/plugins/</code>. Also,
  credential would be entered for <code>https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/trunk/hudson/plugins/</code>
  rather than for the complete URL.
